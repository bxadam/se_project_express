# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This project works with databases, set up security and testing, and deploying web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization. This project follows the CRUD principles and provides extensive interaction with npm and eslint.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
